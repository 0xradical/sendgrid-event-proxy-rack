## Issues

### Delayed Job

Delayed Job is heavily dependent on Rails and while it may work without it,
it requires fugly monkey patches. First of all, DataMapper doesn't work properly
with DJ because the deserialization process is a little different from regular ORMs
and screws up DJ workers. ActiveRecord may be used but then DJ thinks you're in a Rails environment.
You have to explicitly tell it's not, which means fugly patching.
